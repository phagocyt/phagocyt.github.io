    <p>Welcome to my homepage! I am Hui Ji (姬卉), an <a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/aha-funding-opportunities/postdoctoral-fellowship">AHA</a> postdoctoral fellow in <a href="https://luolab.stanford.edu/">Prof. Liqun Luo's</a> lab at Stanford. My research interests lie in the fundamental question of how neural circuits are precisely wired. In 2022, I got my Ph.D. degree in <a href="https://gendev.cornell.edu/">the graduate field of Genetics, Genomics, and Development (GGD)</a> at Cornell University. I conducted my graduate study in the lab of <a href="https://han.wicmb.cornell.edu/">Prof. Chun Han</a> at the <a href="https://wicmb.cornell.edu/">Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology</a>.</p>
<p>For my dissertation work, I investigated how phagocytes, the cells that eat neuronal debris, contribute to neurodegeneration. My first study demonstrated that phagocytes recognize an “eat-me” signal called phosphatidylserine (PS) that is specifically exposed on degenerating neurons. In a follow-up study, my colleagues and I discovered a surprising role of phagocytes in driving the degeneration of injured neuronal branches. My third and very recent study reveals the first secreted PS-bridging molecule in <em>Drosophila</em>. In addition, I have developed “LarvaSPA”, the first method that allows continuous long-term time-lapse live imaging of <em>Drosophila</em> larvae.</p>
