<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->
I am Hui Ji (姬卉), an [AHA](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/aha-funding-opportunities/postdoctoral-fellowship) postdoctoral fellow in [Prof. Liqun Luo's](https://luolab.stanford.edu/) lab at Stanford. My research interests lie in the fundamental question of how neural circuits are precisely wired. In 2022, I got my Ph.D. degree in [the graduate field of Genetics, Genomics, and Development (GGD)](https://gendev.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. I conducted my graduate study in the lab of [Prof. Chun Han](https://han.wicmb.cornell.edu/) at the [Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology](https://wicmb.cornell.edu/).

For my dissertation work, I investigated how phagocytes, the cells that eat neuronal debris, contribute to neurodegeneration. My first study demonstrated that phagocytes recognize an “eat-me” signal called phosphatidylserine (PS) that is specifically exposed on degenerating neurons. In a follow-up study, my colleagues and I discovered a surprising role of phagocytes in driving the degeneration of injured neuronal branches. My third and very recent study reveals the first secreted PS-bridging molecule in *Drosophila*. In addition, I have developed “LarvaSPA”, the first method that allows continuous long-term time-lapse live imaging of *Drosophila* larvae.
